# Hand-Controlled Virtual Mouse with Python

This is a Python script that uses a webcam and the MediaPipe library for hand detection and recognition to create a virtual mouse. With this script, you can control the mouse cursor's movement, perform clicks, and simulate scrolling using hand gestures.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the script, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mediapipe pyautogui opencv-python
